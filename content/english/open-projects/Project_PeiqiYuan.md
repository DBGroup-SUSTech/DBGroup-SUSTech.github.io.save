# Project Introduction

Now is the era of big data, how to efficiently analyze the explosive growth multidimensional data has become a common problem faced by all walks of life. We hope to introduce an efficient data mining and visualization technology that can intelligently extract some insights that users may be more interested in from the multidimensional data tables provided by users. Then, explore the logical connection between these insights, and generate a series of high-quality and meaningful visualized data story segments to show to users. It is very meaningful for analysts in the industry and ordinary people interested in data to find inspiration from the data stories generated by our system for their work.
