# Project Introduction


   Given the similarity function and a query vector, similarity search retrievals several similar vectors to the query. As a fundamental operation in big data, this problem has a wide arrange of applications including machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. Because of the curse of dimensionality and the large-scale data size, traditional exact similarity search becomes slow and infeasible. Therefore, it is demanding to design an efficient and fast similarity search algorithm. Graph-based similarity search gains the popularity for its high performance. However, it suffers from low scalability because of the memory-only support. This project aims at combining SSD and graph-based methods to achieve fast and efficient similarity search.
