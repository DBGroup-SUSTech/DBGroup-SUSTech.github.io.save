      <description>Reserach Project I - 2D Face recognition and 3D Face Modeling Face recognition accuracy has already exceeded the human eye recognition on some public face databases. However, under the public security oriented surveillance environment, the captured face images suffer from many challengs such as pose variation, low resolution, illumination variation and uncontrolled expressions. The changes due to these challenges maybe large than that caused by different identities, which makes the performance of face recognition decrease tremendously.</description>

      <description>Large-scale Similarity Search Similarity search is the task that finds the items that are most similar to a query in a large collection of items. Similarity search is a common task in data science with many applications including recommendation, image search, document retrieval and entity resolution. Many famous companies are devoted to researches on similarity search, e.g., Google, Microsoft and Facebook. However, efficient similarity search is challenging due to large dataset cardinality (e.</description>

      <title>Query Optimization on Big Data System</title>

      <description>When the scale of data is very large, companies usually introduce distributed big data systems to analyze or process the data. In order to facilitate the interaction of developers, there are usually some SQL-based systems like Hive and Flink. In this scenario, query processing time is an important metric for judging the quality of a system. In order to improve development and production efficiency and reduce operation and maintenance costs, optimizing these systems has become an important issue.</description>

      <description>Efficient and effective data visualization Spatial-temporal visualization techniques have been applied in various real-world applications and assist the data exploration by leveraging the sharp perception of human analysts. However, large data visualization is challenging. 1) The long data to visualization latency (query time, computing time and rendering time) always break the continuity of the human involved data exploration loop; 2) visual clutter caused by a large amount of data hinders the ability of the human to discover the insight.</description>
